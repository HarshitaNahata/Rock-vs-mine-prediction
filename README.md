# Rock-vs-mine-prediction
Rock vs. mine prediction is a binary classification problem where the goal is to predict whether an object is a rock or a mine. This can be done using machine learning algorithms, such as logistic regression.

These algorithms can be used to develop models that can accurately predict whether an object is a rock or a mine. This can be a valuable tool for underwater exploration and mining operations.

Here are the steps involved in rock vs. mine prediction using Python:

Collect sonar data from rocks and mines.
Preprocess the sonar data.
Split the data into training and test sets.
Train a machine learning model, such as logistic regression.
Evaluate the model on the test set.
Deploy the model to production.
